## üìù Problem Statement  <a name = "a_1_PS"></a>

<p align="justified"> Usually, the HR department of the firm Atliq uses an Excel sheet that contains employee attendance logs along with other necessary data. We will make a report in Power BI so the data is more presentable, and we can use advanced analytics easily.

### Requirements

Within the report, we try to get the following insights:

- What is the percentage of attendance?
- What is the percentage of work from home?
- On which days do the employees prefer to work from home?
- What is the percentage of sick leave?

### Possible Outcomes

The data insights provided by the dashboard will help management take various measures to increase productivity and employee satisfaction. Some of the possible outcomes are-

- The firm can maximize the efficient use of its space and other resources.
- Find optimum days for meetings and team-building activities.
- The sick leave trends will indicate any form of seasonal diseases, resulting in health precautions and shifting into a temporary remote work model.
